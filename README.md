# dart-rust-minimal-ffi-grpc-example

Building on the excellent starting point provided by truongsinh in
[https://github.com/truongsinh/flutter-plugin-protobuf],
this repo demonstrates how to build a protocol buffers-based messaging
system between Dart and a native library (built in Rust in this case)
over FFI.

Once procotol buffers over FFI are implemented, it is then possible to add
support for GRPC services.
